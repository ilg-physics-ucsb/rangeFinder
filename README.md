# Range Finder

This repository should hold everything related to the range finders made by the ILG for the 6AL lab series. These range finders were made using off the shelf components from adafruit and amazon with a 3D printed case, to solve the issue of tedious data taking in the Energy Conservation lab in 6AL. For information on the components visit the datasheets folder, for information on the housing view the CAD folder, and to view the code view the code folder.
